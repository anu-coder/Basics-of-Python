'''
Question A robot moves in a plane starting from the original point (0,0). 
The robot can move toward UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT 
with a given steps. 
The trace of robot movement is shown as the following: 
UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2Â­ 
The numbers after the direction are steps. 
Please write a program to compute the distance from current position 
after a sequence of movement and original point. 
If the distance is a float, then just print the nearest integer. 
Example: If the following tuples are given as input to the program: 
UP 5 DOWN 3 LEFT 3 RIGHT 2 
Then, the output of the program should be: 2

EXAMPLE broken down:
Consider x-axis and y-axis:
(0,0) UP 5 (0,5)
(0,5) DOWN 3 (0,2)
(0,2) LEFT 3 (-3,2)
(-3,2) RIGHT 2 (-1,2)

Distance from initial (round(sqrt(i*i+j*j))) = 2
