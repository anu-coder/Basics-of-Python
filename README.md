# Basics of Python

 Contains part of the codes and the notebooks of my python journey.
 This was also a way to incorporate git in my regular learning workflow. 

 It contains: 
  > scrips

  > notebooks
 

 Starting all over on 20/03/2021:

 Recently in a 5days marathon python practise added 100 more practise solutions to scripts starting L1Q1-L4Q100

 The questions can be found [here](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises%20for%20Python%203.md) 
 
 All the folders contains their individual readme. 
 Do peep into them!
